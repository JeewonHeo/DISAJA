# DISAJA
DISAJA is a deep learning framework implementing the model and training code described in the paper [Improving the Direct Determination of |$$V_{ts}$$| using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02918).
This repository provides the complete implementation for model construction, training, allowing you to reproduce and extend the experiments presented in the paper.

## Overview 
The repository contains:
	* Model Implementation: Code for the architecture as detailed in the referenced paper.
	* Training Scripts: Configurable training routines to experiment with different hyperparameters.


## Installation
Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/JeewonHeo/DISAJA.git
cd DISAJA
```
